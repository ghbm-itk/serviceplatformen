Calling this service is extremely simple, but it's extremely hard to navigate
the documentation and understand how to actually authenticate and call the
service.

## Generating classes from XML Schema Definitions

We use [xsd2php](https://github.com/goetas-webservices/xsd2php) to generate PHP
classes from XML Schema Definitions (XSD) from
<https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/5248921>
([MeMo_XSD.zip](https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/5248921/artefact/MeMo_XSD.zip)).

See [`bin/xsd2php`](bin/xsd2php) for details on how XSDs are converted to PHP
classes.

To generate or update the generated PHP classes, run

```sh
./bin/xsd2php
```
